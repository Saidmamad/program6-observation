Hello guys!

The goto statement which is used in the program, is not so good idea, although I know that it works well so far :) 
Refer to the below link to read more about why you should avoid using goto statement:

Therefore, the 6th program of the observation could be written for the better performance.

Have a nice time! :-) 

Aim of the program:
to write a C# program that accepts two integer numbers from user and displays them. But if both of the values are greater than 10, then it should discard the values and ask the user to enter new values.
